- DKIM (need a node dkim library first - perhaps based on libdkimpp?)
- Rate Limiting for outbound mail
- Milter support
- Ability to modify the body of email (e.g add a banner) and have it re-write the data_lines
- Create a config file for each of the core shipping configs, so people have something as a baseline
- IMAP server (long shot for now)
